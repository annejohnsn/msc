In the course of developing a generalized factorial function, Manjul Bhargava introduced the notion of $p-$orderings of a Dedekind domain \cite{mb1, mb2}, a combinatorial concept which, along with his generalized factorial, provided deep and perhaps unexpected results in number theory. The concepts laid down in these papers have enriched the theory of integer-valued polynomials \cite{mb3, kj2} and have also provided a natural framework to extend many classical results in analysis to a $p-$adic setting, such as polynomial approximation and mapping theorems \cite{mb1, mb2,mb3}. In this thesis, we examine how a tool based on $p-$orderings can extend another concept from classical analysis, namely the \textit{valuative capacity} of a set, to non-archimedean settings.\\

The historical background to this work comes in two parts. On the one hand, there is the background on logarithmic capacity from potential theory, and secondly, there is the background from Bhargava's $p-$orderings. We give a brief summary of each here. A similar treatment, with slightly different perspective, is found in \cite{fp}. Jean-Luc Chabert was the first to draw a connection between the two, and many of the known results in this area stem from his work or that of his colleagues. Building on the result in \cite{kj}, we extend the work by Chabert and colleagues by studying valuative capacity in a more general setting, namely that of an ultrametric space, which may or may not also be a local field. In doing so, we show many properties of capacities are in fact independent of the algebraic structure of a space, although the such structure, when it exists, can act as a useful probe.\\

\section{Logarithmic capacity}
The theory of capacity has been developed as a topic in potential theory in a variety of settings. Classically, the notion of capacity was developed over both $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$, although the theory has been further developed in a rather general way by Rumely for Berkovich spaces. A  signficant body of work on the analytic properties of capacity can be found for a number of contexts. For example, such a treatment of the subject over $\mathbb{C}$ can be found in \cite{wer} and \cite{rand}, over Berovich spaces in \cite{rum}, and over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ in \cite{dgc}. We give a brief account of capacity over $\mathbb{C}$ here, presenting only the most essential definitions and results.   One advantage of tracing the historical roots of capacity back to $\mathbb{C}$ is that the theory in this setting also comes equipped with a physical interpretation. As we are about to see, capacity, in the classical sense, gives a mathematical model for the amount of electrostatic charge a conductor can hold. The exposition below is closely based on Ransford \cite{rand}.\\

Even restricting ourself to the definition of capacity of subsets of $\mathbb{C}$, we find two paths - one which will give us some physical interpretation and one which will lead more naturally to $p-$orderings. We start with the former.\\

\begin{definition} 
\cite{rand} Let $\mu$ be a finite Borel measure on $\mathbb{C}$ and suppose $\mu$ has compact support.  We associate to $\mu$ a function
\[p_\mu (x) =\int \log \lvert x - y \rvert d\mu(y)\] called the \textbf{potential function} of $\mu$. The \textbf{energy} of $\mu$ is 
\[I(\mu) =\int \int \log \lvert x - y \rvert d\mu(y) d\mu(x)\]
\end{definition}

This gives at once the physical interpretation promised above. We interpret the potential function of a measure as giving the potential energy of a point. Viewing the measure as a charge distribution, the double integral gives back the total energy in the system. Now we come upon a physical reality: particles in a conductor will naturally distribute themselves as to minimize the energy. This leads to the definition below:\\

\begin{definition}
\cite{rand} Let $K$ be a compact subset of $\mathbb{C}$ and let $\mathcal{P}(K)$ be the set of Borel probability measures on $K$. If $\nu \in \mathcal{P}(K)$ is such that 
\[I(\nu) = \sup_{\mu \in \mathcal{P}(k)} I(\mu)\] then $\nu$ is a \textbf{equilibrium measure} for $K$.
\end{definition}

We state the following proposition without proof. A sketch of the proof can be found in \cite{fp} and the full details can be found in \cite{rand}.\\

\begin{proposition}
\cite{rand} The equilibrium measure exists for every compact set $K \in \mathbb{C}$. When finite, the equilibrium measure is unique and isometry-invariant.
\end{proposition}

We are now ready to give our first definition of capacity.\\

\begin{definition}
\cite{rand} Let $K$ be a compact subset of $\mathbb{C}$. The logarithmic capacity of $E$ is 
\[C(K) = e^{I(\nu)}\] where $\nu$ is the equilibrium measure on $K$.
\end{definition}

We present below a few results on capacity in $\mathbb{C}$. We will see similar results on capacity reappear in the remainder of this work, although the context, and the proofs (omitted here), bear little resemblence to the present case.\\ 

\begin{proposition}
[\textbf{Randsford, 5.1.2}] Let $K,  K_1,K_2$ be compact subsets of $\mathbb{C}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $K_1 \subseteq K_2$, then $C(K_1) \leq C(K_2)$.
\item $C(\alpha K + \beta) = \lvert \alpha \rvert C(K)$ for all $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$.
\item $C(K) = C(\delta_eK)$, where $\delta_e$ is the exterior boundary of $K$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
[\textbf{Randsford, 5.1.4}] 
Suppose $\{B_n\}$ is a sequence of Borel subsets of $\mathbb{C}$. Let $B=\cup_n B_n$ and $d \geq 0$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $diam(b) \leq d$, then $C(B) \leq d$ and \[\frac{1}{log(\frac{d}{C(B)})} \leq \sum_n \frac{1}{log(\frac{d}{C(B_n)})}\]
\item If $dist(B_j, B_k) \geq d$ whenever $j \neq k$, then \[\frac{1}{log^+(\frac{d}{C(B)})} \geq \sum_n \frac{1}{log^+(\frac{d}{C(B_n)})}\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

We now know show an alternate definition of capacity, still over $\mathbb{C}$, which starts with the following two definitions due to Fekete \cite{fek}.\\ 

\begin{definition}
Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ be a compact subset. Fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and for $z = (z_1,\ldots,z_n) \in K^n$, consider
\[\prod_{i < j} \lvert z_i - z_j \rvert^{\frac{2}{(n(n-1))}} \]
An element $z = (z_1,\ldots,z_n) \in K^n$ is called a \textbf{Fekete n-tuple} if $z$ maximizes the above over all $n-$tuples in $K$.
\end{definition}

Note that since $K$ is compact by assumption, a Fekete $n-$tuple exists for each $n$.\\

\begin{definition}
Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ be a compact subset. The \textbf{transfinite diameter} of $K$ is \[ \lim_{n\to\infty}\max_z  \prod_{i < j} \lvert z_i - z_j \rvert^{\frac{2}{(n(n-1))}}\] where the maximum is taken over all $n-$tuples in $K$. 
\end{definition}

The following proposition shows the relation to capacity.\\

\begin{proposition}
\textbf{[Fekete-Szeg\"o Theorem]} If $K$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{C}$, then the transfinite diameter of $K$ is equal to the logarithmic capacity of $K$.
\end{proposition}

%\begin{definition}
%Chebyshev constant
%\end{definition}

%\begin{definition}
%The \textbf{Robin constant} of a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is 
%\[\inf_{\mu \in \mathcal{P}(E)} \int \int \log \lvert x-y \rvert^{-1} d\mu(y) d\mu(x) \]
%\end{definition}

We end this section with an observation about the points $z_i$ in $\mathbb{C}$ making up a Fekete n-tuple. For $n \geq 2$, if $(z_1,\ldots,z_{n+1})$ is a Fekete $(n+1)-$tuple, then $(z_1,\ldots,z_n)$ is not a Fekete $n-$tuple. In physical terms, we note that the placement of a new charge in a conductor will change the location of the existing charges in that conductor. Remarkably, this is not the case in ultrametric spaces. Indeed, we are able to build the analogous structure, which we call a $p-$ordering or more generally a $\rho-$ordering, \textit{recursively}, that is by reusing the points from the previous iteration.
